# Cyber Security Internship - Task 8: VPNs for Privacy and Secure Communication

## Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for Task 8 of the Cyber Security Internship, focusing on understanding and practically applying Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for online privacy and secure communication.

## Objective

[cite_start]The primary objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with VPNs and understand their crucial role in protecting user privacy and ensuring secure communication over various networks. 

## Tools Used

* [cite_start]**Free VPN Client:** [ProtonVPN Free Tier / Windscribe Free]  (Replace with the actual VPN service you used)

## Task Steps Performed

The following steps were undertaken to complete the task:

1.  [cite_start]**VPN Service Selection & Signup:** Chose a reputable free VPN service and successfully signed up for an account. 
2.  [cite_start]**Client Download & Installation:** Downloaded and installed the VPN client software on the local system. 
3.  [cite_start]**Connection to VPN Server:** Connected to a VPN server, typically choosing a geographically close location or an available server. 
4.  [cite_start]**IP Address Verification:** Verified that the public IP address had changed using `whatismyipaddress.com` after connecting to the VPN. 
5.  [cite_start]**Traffic Encryption Confirmation:** Browsed various websites to confirm that internet traffic was being routed through the encrypted VPN tunnel. 
6.  [cite_start]**VPN Disconnection & Speed/IP Comparison:** Disconnected the VPN and compared Browse speed and the public IP address to the state when the VPN was active. 
7.  [cite_start]**Research on VPN Features:** Conducted research on key VPN concepts, including encryption methods and privacy features. 
8.  [cite_start]**Summary Generation:** Prepared a comprehensive summary outlining the benefits and limitations of using a VPN. 

## Deliverables

* **Report:** A detailed report describing the VPN setup steps, the findings from IP verification, and the summary of VPN benefits and limitations.
* **Connection Status Screenshot:** A screenshot demonstrating the VPN client's connected status and/or the `whatismyipaddress.com` result showing the changed IP.

## Screenshot

(Insert your VPN connection status screenshot here. You can drag and drop it into your GitHub repository or use Markdown to link it.)

## VPN Benefits and Limitations Summary

(Paste the summary you wrote about VPN benefits and limitations here. This should cover points like how VPNs protect privacy, the difference between VPN and proxy, encryption, anonymity, protocols, and limitations.)
